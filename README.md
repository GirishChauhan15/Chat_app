# 💬 Real-Time Chat App — MERN Stack (Personal Project)

A full-featured, real-time chat application built with the **MERN stack**, focused on performance, privacy, and modern user experience. This is a personal project, crafted to sharpen my full-stack development skills and demonstrate real-world implementation of secure, scalable communication features.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, TailwindCSS, Redux Toolkit, Socket.io-client

## 🔐 End-to-End Encryption — Architected for Trust

In this app, privacy isn’t a toggle — it’s the default.

- 🔒 Messages, images, and profile photos are encrypted 
- 🧩 The backend validates incoming data, encrypts it before storage, and handles all payloads without exposing sensitive content — ensuring that only the client can decode what truly matters.

> A privacy-first architecture that protects user data beyond standard HTTPS — rare in personal projects, and thoughtfully executed here.
